# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yuta Maesawa!

I'm an engineering student at the University of Tokyo passionate about the intersection of AI, backend development, and real-world applications. With hands-on experience in software engineering, data analysis, and AI-powered SaaS development, I aim to bridge cutting-edge technologies with pressing societal needsâ€”especially in industries where digital transformation is still emerging.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

- **RAG-powered SaaS for Japanese Manufacturing**  
  Developed a FastAPI-based backend for a SaaS solution that integrates OpenAI's API via Azure. Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to summarize and retrieve industrial documents. Dockerized the application and deployed it with MySQL, supporting DX in the manufacturing sector.

- **IoT Predictive Maintenance System**  
  Led a five-month team project to stream and analyze real-time data from factory PLCs for predictive maintenance. Managed cross-functional development and delivered the solution as an internal product. Served as project manager and was the only student among full-time engineers.

- **Plasma Physics Research & AI Applications**  
  Conducting nuclear fusion research at the University of Tokyo using Python for data analysis. Presented at the 41st JSPF Annual Meeting. Also took machine learning coursework during an exchange program at UC Santa Cruz, further deepening my interest in AI for science.
